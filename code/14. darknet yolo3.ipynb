    "```\n",
    "for Windows users you will need to have `make` on your machine. There are multiple ways to obtain it, simplest one is to have [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/getting_started) installed. If you have `mingw-get.exe` binary from [here](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-0.6.3-mingw32-pre-20170905-1-bin.zip/) just run following commands and don't forget to add binaries to `PATH` (`./bin` and `./msys/1.0/bin`).\n",

    "For me worked:\n",
    "1. Goto **`Makefile`** and remove `go.o` and `cifar.o` mentions in line 62.\n",
    "2. Remove `run_go` and `run_cifar` function declaration and calls from **`/examples/darknet.c`** (lines 19, 20, 439, 441).\n",
