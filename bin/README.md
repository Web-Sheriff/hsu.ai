## Prebuilt files ##
`*.exe` files are built using MinGW x86 gcc compiler v9.2.0. They are not utilizing OpenCV or CUDA, thus at least clean version should work at almost any Windows machine.

Other binaries are built at Ubuntu x64 18.04 using gcc compiler v7.4.0. Also not utilizing OpenCV or CUDA.

To start safe, download [darknet-clean.exe](./darknet-clean.exe) for Windows of [darknet-clean](./darknet-clean) for Ubuntu.
